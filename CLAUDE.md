This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## Project Overview

**Cyber Response Agent (v3)** — A hypothesis-driven security alert triage system. Reduces SOC analyst workload by investigating alerts through iterative hypothesis elimination, validating findings against precedents, and recommending disposition.

**Key Goal**: Zero false negatives (never auto-close real threats), high precision recommendations, mean time to resolution of 1-3 minutes.

**Approach**: Claude Code plugin with a hypothesis-driven investigation loop. The agent forms hypotheses, gathers evidence from whatever SIEM/query tools are available via MCP, eliminates candidates with structured assessments, and stops when confident. Hooks enforce structural safety. MVP is `recommend`-only. The plugin is **vendor-neutral** — it works with any SIEM that exposes tools via MCP. Wazuh signatures are included as working examples.

## Architecture

### Investigation Loop

        │   (context.md + playbook.md + checklist.md + @import: atoms)
        │
        └── CONTEXTUALIZE → [SCREEN] → HYPOTHESIZE → GATHER → ANALYZE
                                 │           ↑                    │
                                 │           └────── loop ────────┘
                                 │                                │
                                 └──────────────────────┬─────────┘
                                                        │
                                                   CONCLUDE → report.md
```

The optional SCREEN phase spawns a cheap subagent (Sonnet/Haiku) that attempts fast pattern matching against playbook-defined screen patterns. If matched, skips the full loop. If not, passes gathered evidence into the full investigation.

### Core Components

| Component | Path | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **Investigate Skill** | `soc-agent/skills/investigate/SKILL.md` | Entry point + investigation loop (merged skill) |
| **Screen Prompt** | `soc-agent/skills/investigate/screen.md` | Subagent prompt for fast pattern matching (SCREEN phase) |
| **Import Resolver** | `soc-agent/scripts/resolve_imports.py` | `!command` preprocessing: resolves signature knowledge |
| **Validate Report Hook** | `soc-agent/hooks/scripts/validate_report.py` | PostToolUse hook (Write\|Edit): combined Tier 1 + Tier 2 validation |
| **Judge Prompt** | `soc-agent/hooks/scripts/judge_prompt.md` | Prompt template for Tier 2 judge (5 criteria, two modes) |
| **Infer State Hook** | `soc-agent/hooks/scripts/infer_state.py` | PostToolUse hook: infers state transitions from investigation.md headers |
| **Investigation Summary Hook** | `soc-agent/hooks/scripts/investigation_summary.py` | JSONL outcome log per completed investigation |
| **Tool Call Audit Hook** | `soc-agent/hooks/scripts/audit_tool_calls.py` | PostToolUse: audit + trace JSONL split |

### Safety Architecture

- **Two-tier validation** — `validate_report.py` is a PostToolUse hook (Write|Edit) that fires when report.md is written. Tier 1 enforces structural constraints deterministically. Tier 2 uses Haiku via claude CLI to validate report consistency, precedent match validity, and evidence sufficiency. Runs in full mode (5 checks) for resolved reports with precedent, or no-precedent mode (4 checks) for escalated reports. Untrusted content (alert data, investigation log) is wrapped in per-run salted delimiters to prevent prompt injection.
- **Hooks registered in plugin.json** — hooks only fire when the plugin is loaded, not during development
- **State machine** (`infer_state.py` PostToolUse hook) prevents phase skipping — inferred from `## PHASE` headers in `investigation.md`, agent must follow CONTEXTUALIZE→[SCREEN]→HYPOTHESIZE→GATHER→ANALYZE→(loop|CONCLUDE)
- **Two-leg resolution requirement** — `status=resolved` requires `matched_archetype` naming an archetype directory AND grounding: every `required_anchors` entry confirmed OR `matched_ticket_id` citing a valid precedent snapshot inside that archetype directory. Archetypes with no required anchors must be grounded by `matched_ticket_id`
- **Adversarial hypothesis** — agent must maintain at least one threat hypothesis until explicitly refuted

## Task Tracking

Open work lives in `tasks/` — one markdown file per task with `title`, `status` (`backlog` / `todo` / `doing` / `done`), and `groups` (comma-separated tags) frontmatter. Body is free-form context. Run `python3 tasks/build.py` to regenerate `board.html`. A task may carry multiple group tags; each renders as its own badge. This replaced the legacy `todo.md` — open issues (state-machine bypass mitigation, validation-hook promotion, SCREEN cost-reduction workstream, Sonnet-migration stages, etc.) all live as task files now.

## Python Environment

All deps are declared as extras in `soc-agent/pyproject.toml` and installed into a single venv at `soc-agent/.venv`. Run `cd soc-agent && uv sync --extra dev` to create or update it; invoke scripts and tests via `soc-agent/.venv/bin/python3` (or activate with `source soc-agent/.venv/bin/activate`).

## Running Tests

```bash
# All unit tests (no LLM required, ~25s — subprocess-heavy state tests)
pytest soc-agent/tests/ -v -m "not llm"

# Specific test suites
pytest soc-agent/tests/test_validate_report.py -v    # Report validation
pytest soc-agent/tests/test_state_transitions.py -v   # State machine
pytest soc-agent/tests/test_kb_schema.py -v           # Knowledge base
pytest soc-agent/tests/test_audit_hooks.py -v         # Audit hooks

# Integration tests (require LLM)
pytest soc-agent/tests/test_e2e_mock.py -m llm        # Mock SIEM
pytest soc-agent/tests/test_e2e_live.py -m "llm and live"  # Live Wazuh
```

## Investigation Flow Language

**Full spec:** `docs/investigation-language.md` (v2.6, implemented). CLI query tool: `soc-agent/scripts/invlang/cli.py`.

### Purpose

The investigation language is a structured YAML schema for recording security investigations as **graph traversals**. Each investigation produces a companion document — a machine-readable + human-readable audit trail of every hypothesis, lead, observation, and weight update from alert to disposition. Companions are designed to be corpus-queryable: which hypothesis patterns recur, which leads are most discriminating, where investigations stall.

### Philosophy

An investigation maintains two layers: a **confirmed graph** (vertices/edges backed by SIEM events, runtime audit, or authoritative sources — append-only, never mutated) and a **proposed frontier** (one candidate upstream extension per active hypothesis). Leads collapse the frontier: each lead is an edge measurement that either materializes proposed elements into the confirmed graph or refutes them.

Investigations traverse **backward** — from the observed alert toward upstream causes — halting when the frontier is empty or a **trust root** is reached (a vertex with no accessible upstream). The agent is not allowed to pre-commit to deep causal narratives; hypotheses are lean (1–2 predictions, the minimum that discriminates between competing explanations), deepened only when evidence forces it.

Inline vocabulary used in `investigation.md`:
- **Hypotheses** prefixed with `?` — e.g., `?monitoring-probe`, `?brute-force`
- **Leads** — evidence-gathering actions that discriminate between hypotheses
- **Assessments** — `++` (strongly supports), `+` (weakly supports), `-` (weakly refutes), `--` (strongly refutes)
- **Trace** — compressed investigation path: `lead1(result)→lead2(result)→disposition:hypothesis`

### Companion structure (top-level)

```yaml
prologue:       # CONTEXTUALIZE: vertices + edges derived from the alert
  vertices: []
  edges: []

hypothesize:    # HYPOTHESIZE: initial proposed frontier (omit for SCREEN-matched cases)
  hypotheses: []

gather:         # GATHER + ANALYZE: ordered lead blocks
  - lead: {...}

conclude:       # CONCLUDE: termination category, disposition, confidence, matched_archetype
  termination:
    category: trust-root | adversarial-refuted | severity-ceiling | exhaustion-escalation
  disposition: benign | true_positive | unclear
  confidence: high | medium | low
  matched_archetype: <name> | null
```

The key invariants enforced by the validator (18 rules in total — see spec §Validator rules):
- **Edge authority** — `++`/`--` resolutions must cite at least one `siem-event`, `runtime-audit`, or `authoritative-source` edge.
- **Append-only** — no existing record is ever mutated; decomposition adds sub-vertices, attribution adds `identified_as` links.
- **Mechanical leads stay within their data source** — a lead's observations contain only entities the queried system directly names by native identity.

## Key Design Patterns

### Hypothesis-Driven Investigation
- Agent forms candidate explanations, makes predictions, gathers evidence
- Must maintain adversarial hypothesis until explicitly refuted
- Structured assessments (++/+/-/--) replace subjective confidence

### Hook-Enforced Safety
- Python hooks validate report structure (no LLM judgment in safety checks)
- State machine prevents phase skipping
- Precedent match required for non-escalation resolution

### Conservative by Default
- When uncertain, escalate to human
- MVP is recommend-only (no auto-close actions)
- Missing data or errors → escalate with context

### Auditability
- Every investigation creates: alert.json, investigation.md, state.json, report.md
- JSONL investigation outcomes in runs/audit.jsonl
- JSONL tool call audit trail in runs/tool_audit.jsonl (state-changing tools)
- JSONL tool call trace in runs/tool_trace.jsonl (read-only tools, for debugging)
- Full phase-by-phase investigation log

## Adding a New Signature

See `soc-agent/knowledge/signatures/_template/README.md` for the full onboarding workflow. Summary:

1. Copy template: `cp -r soc-agent/knowledge/signatures/_template soc-agent/knowledge/signatures/{signature-id}`
2. Remove `README.md` from the copy
3. Research past tickets for this signature — pull alerts, review closed tickets, identify outcome clusters
4. Fill in `context.md` — signature logic, threat model, known false positives (grounded in real data)
5. Fill in `playbook.md` — archetype catalog, leads with predictions, optional screen table (from actual investigation patterns)
   - Optionally use `@import:name` inline to reference common lessons from `knowledge/common-investigation/lessons/`
   - The resolver (`scripts/resolve_imports.py`) loads referenced atoms automatically at skill load time
6. Create one archetype subdirectory per outcome cluster under `archetypes/{archetype-name}/` — each with a `README.md` (story + `required_anchors`) and zero or more `{TICKET-ID}.json` precedent snapshots
7. Create `soc-agent/config/signatures/{signature-id}/permissions.yaml`

## Docker Environment

Multi-container stack (`.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`):

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **devcontainer** | Development environment with Docker socket access |
| **target-endpoint** | Ubuntu container generating workload activity |
| **falco** | eBPF syscall monitoring |
| **wazuh-mcp-server** | MCP interface to Wazuh API |
| **wazuh.manager** | SIEM alert correlation |
| **wazuh.indexer** | Elasticsearch for events |
| **wazuh.dashboard** | Web UI |
| **ticket-server** | Stateful FastAPI mock ticketing API (playground only) |

### Managing Containers

Always go through Compose. Never bare `docker run/start/stop/rm` on a Compose-managed container, and never invoke compose with a partial `-f` set — that splits the stack into parallel projects and collides on names like `target-endpoint`, requiring manual cleanup.

The canonical entry point is `playground/scripts/compose.sh`, which works identically from the host shell and from inside the devcontainer:

```bash
playground/scripts/compose.sh up -d --build target-endpoint
playground/scripts/compose.sh ps
playground/scripts/compose.sh logs -f wazuh-manager
playground/scripts/compose.sh down
```

The wrapper handles two pieces of plumbing that are otherwise easy to get wrong:
1. **Project name** (`cyber-response-agent_devcontainer`) — set via `name:` at the top of `docker-compose.yml`, picked up automatically
2. **File list** — set via `COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:wazuh-stack.yml:wazuh-overrides.yml` in `.devcontainer/.env`
3. **Path translation when running from inside the devcontainer** — the docker daemon runs on the host and only speaks host paths, so compose needs `--project-directory` pointing at the host-style `.devcontainer/` for bind mount sources to resolve correctly. The wrapper sets this from `HOST_WORKSPACE` in `.devcontainer/.env`.

`.devcontainer/.env` must be created from `.devcontainer/.env.example` and have `HOST_WORKSPACE` filled in per machine. From a fresh checkout:
```bash
cp .devcontainer/.env.example .devcontainer/.env
# edit .devcontainer/.env, set HOST_WORKSPACE to the host path that maps to /workspace
```

**Persistent agent state.** The target-endpoint Wazuh agent state (`client.keys`, FIM database, anti-replay counters) persists across container recreates via the `target-endpoint-state` named volume. Combined with the `<force>` block in the manager's `<auth>` config (`playground/config/wazuh_cluster/wazuh_manager.conf`), this means container recreate / rebuild "just works" — no manual deregistration needed. To force a fresh enrollment, `docker volume rm cyber-response-agent_devcontainer_target-endpoint-state`.

## Credentials (Development Only)

Credentials are stored in `.env` (git-ignored). See `.env` for Wazuh API, indexer, and dashboard passwords. The `.env` file is loaded by docker-compose services and should be sourced or exported for CLI usage.

## Fail Fast — No Guessing

When a required value is missing, unknown, or ambiguous — **fail immediately with a clear error**. Never silently substitute a default, placeholder, or made-up value. This applies everywhere: scripts, hooks, skill arguments, tool parameters, queries, and field mappings.

- If a required argument is not provided, stop and ask or error out.
- If a field name, index, or API path is uncertain, surface the uncertainty — don't guess.
- If a SIEM query field might not exist, say so rather than fabricating a plausible name.
- Prefer a loud failure the user can diagnose over a silent wrong answer they can't.

## Known Issues

- Wazuh API not accessible from localhost (use `wazuh-manager:55000` from within Docker network)
- Falco generates alerts for healthcheck operations (expected behavior)
- `act` mode implemented for `close_ticket` only; additional action verbs (`block_ip`, `disable_user`, `isolate_host`) not yet supported. Graduation is per-signature via `permissions.yaml`; see `soc-agent/skills/handbook/content/act-mode.md`.
