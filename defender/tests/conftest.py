"""Shared fixtures for defender learning-loop tests.

Each test gets an isolated tmp git repo with the ``defender/learning/`` source
files copied in. The fixture builds one ``LoopPaths(repo_root=tmp)`` and an
``AuthorConfig`` from it (``ctx.paths`` / ``ctx.cfg``); tests thread those into
``author.run_batch(paths=…, cfg=…)`` and inject a fake curator via
``dataclasses.replace(cfg, invoke_agent=fake)`` — no module-global setattr, no
``importlib.reload``.
